Project Name:
Luxury Cars Showroom

Project Description:
Create a dynamic web application that showcases luxury cars like Range Rover, Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc. The website will display details about each car, including images, price, features, and user reviews. Visitors can interact with the site to view a carâ€™s detailed specifications, check its availability, and even simulate booking a test drive. The project will fetch real-time car data using a public API, incorporate user interactions using JavaScript DOM and Event Listeners, and display the content beautifully using HTML and CSS.

Project MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
Home Page: A landing page featuring a carousel/slideshow of top luxury cars.
Car Gallery: A gallery showing cars fetched from a public API, including their images and basic details like name, price, and a "More Info" button.
Car Details Page: When a user clicks "More Info," they see a detailed page about the selected car, including specs like horsepower, engine type, and user reviews.
Booking Feature: A form that allows users to book a test drive, with a confirmation message displayed on form submission.
Search Functionality: A search bar that filters cars by brand, price range, or features.
Responsive Design: The application should look good on desktops and mobile devices.
Stretch Goals (Optional Advanced Features):
Allow users to rate and review cars (store data locally or simulate using JSON).
Include a "Favorites" feature where users can save their preferred cars.
Show car availability dynamically (e.g., "In Stock" or "Sold Out").
Add animations for page transitions and button interactions using CSS.

Create structured pages for the home, car gallery, and details.
Include a navigation bar and forms for booking.
CSS:

Make the design responsive with media queries.
JavaScript Basics:

Handle the car data fetched from the API (e.g., parse JSON responses).
Create functions to filter cars, handle bookings, and manage dynamic content.
DOM Manipulation:

Dynamically update the gallery based on API data.
Show/hide car details and confirmation messages.
Event Listeners:

Handle button clicks (e.g., "More Info," "Book Test Drive").
